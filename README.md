# :chess_pawn::clock1: CPSC Program Similar to Chess

## What will the application do?
**CPSC** (CPSC Program Similar to Chess) allows users to play a variant of chess with only premoves. In other words, all moves must be made a certain number of turns in advance. The longer the delay, the more difficult it is to predict and react to the opponent's strategy.

## Who will use it?
Anyone with some free time and a friend to play with can try **CPSC**, especially those with an interest in chess.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
Chess has recently undergone an unprecedented rise in popularity, and I wanted to try putting a unique spin on the classic format. Additionally, from a programming standpoint, I believe that chess is a sufficiently complex game which will be challenging but rewarding to implement.
